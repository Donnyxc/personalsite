You're probably asking yourself, "What does sizzlexc mean?"

Once upon a time, there was a young boy from Newton, MA. He was tan in complexion, had light eyes, and looked like a picky eater. This boy took a Technology class at Brown Middle School where he built his first website using HTML. At first, he loved this but wondered why you couldn't just use blogspot or something to move things around instead of having to hand-write it yourself? 

This boy spent the next several years toying around with this "content management system" concept, but eventually became more curious with the hand-written building blocks of websites. When he was not on his computer, this boy was running. All kinds of running. Up hills, through busy intersections, in desolate forrests, around a high school track - you name it. His lean complexion (the picky eating helped) added to the endearing sobriquet formed by his friends; "Sizzle". 

He blazed around the track. One cold February day in 2007 he set a record for the fastest 1 mile that any high schooler had ever run while attending Newton South. He ran in the snow, rain, or shine. He ran cross country (Commonly associated with the acronym "XC"). Sizzlexc became the identity of this young long distance runner who, when not running, spent lots of time on his computer - to his mother's chagrin.

It's been 15 years since I started running, and I'm still doing it. What for? What am I running from? running to? Various thing. I've run in about 20 States in the U.S., 10 different countries in Europe, several cities in Asia. I was probably running in South America when I was born. I place a lot of value in my own experiences and I translate this kind of wonderous everchanging dynamic mindset to User Experience and Design.
